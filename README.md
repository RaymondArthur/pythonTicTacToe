# Python Tic-Tac-Toe game
A simple implementation of tic tac toe in Python 3.

I've been working through "Automate the boring stuff" and thought I would try and implement the tic-tac-toe game in the Dictionaries chapter.

This repo is my implementation.

# Details
I use a dictionary (similar to a JSON object) to track the tic-tac-toe board.

From there, there are a few functions that:
* render the board to the console
* clear the board in the event of a game restart
* check the board for a 'win' or a 'draw'

It was a fun project that helped solidify the learnings from chapter 5 of "Automate the boring stuff".
